## Welcome to **arthuranteater**! ### Built for sharing projects, coding challenges, new tech, and best practices!  


I'm Hunt Applegate, a software engineer from Denver, CO. I'm always looking to collaborate on awesome projects. Got an ideas for website, project, or post?  

**<a href="https://www.huntcodes.co/" target="_blank">Contact Me</a>**

When I'm not coding, I'm outside enjoying the beautiful mountains. I enjoy hiking, fly-fishing, camping, and skiing. I'm a member of social clubs for travel, learning Spanish, and coding. I'm a believer in meditation and living a healthy lifestyle.

Thanks for visiting!
