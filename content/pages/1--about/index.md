Shortly after graduating college, I started my own insurance agency, Applegate Consulting. After growing my practice for 7 years, I was ready for a new challenge. I've always enjoyed problem solving and building things. These two interests led me to coding.

In 2017, I got my first taste of programming. I took a part-time class with the Data Science program at Galvanize in Denver. I knew I was getting into something that could challenge me. I really enjoyed the challenge and the culture at Galvanize. I decided this was my next career! I enrolled in the Web Development Immersive Program through Galvanize in June of 2018. The 6 month program takes you from the basics to full stack web development. I fought hard to gain as much knowledge as I could about Javascript, React.js, Node.js, and other technologies. I completed the infamous capstone project, where you are challeged to incorporate multiple new technologies into a full stack application, generate a demo, and deliver a presentation within a week. After graduation I realized though that my journey into software development had only just begun.

I'm currently working on a React, Redux full stack application to get more comfortable with the Redux flow. Please contact me if you have any interest in my projects. Check out my blog for more on my latest projects!

When I'm not coding, I'm outside enjoying the beautiful mountains. I enjoy hiking, fly-fishing, camping, and skiing. I'm a member of social clubs for travel, learning Spanish, and computer programming. I'm a believer in meditation and living a healthy lifestyle.
