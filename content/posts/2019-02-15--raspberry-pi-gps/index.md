For my Glavanzie capstone project the assignment was to create a new full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that solved a problem with at least one new technology in 10 days. My idea was to create a mobile app where people could track their pets via GPS. I was unable to find a great guide that encompassed all of the information I needed for this project, so I spent most of my time googling. I'm writing this in hopes that others can tackle this project with ease.

Checklist:

1) Raspberry Pi 3B
2) Arduino NEO 6M GPS module
3) Input and Output Wires (Comes with Pi Cana Kit - see picture)
4) Sautering iron and female blocks (helpful, not necessary)
4) External moniter with HDMI connection for Pi (TV or similar display) or Pi USB wireless connector or ethernet cable with adapter
5) Mac (helpful, but can be done on PC)
6) Wireless internet connection
7) Patience

Steps:

1) Setting up the Pi
2) Connecting the GPS module
3) Testing the device
4) Parsing and sending data
5) Testing the server
